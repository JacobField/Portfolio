      "I wanted to showcase my passion for AI and commitment to learning by utilizing the OpenAI API in a React-based app. The app prompts the OpenAI API, generating Haikus based on user input and providing a simple yet impactful user experience. This project enriched my skills in using the OpenAI API, managing API Keys, and implementing environment variables with React, and it developed my understanding of the asynchronous nature of fetch requests through overcoming issues with data rendering before previous requests were complete.",

      "The purpose of this app was to increase my understanding of how React works, how it renders components, and how array methods can be utilised to dynamically create UIs. I learned a lot about how to dynamically display content, about how React works with array methods and how best to utilise this wonderful tool, all the while developing my knowledge of React via the flashcard info. It was a great project, and the flashcard data could easily be changed to help students study",

      "I utilized React to develop a Noughts and Crosses app, with the aim of developing learning and delving into advanced React features. I contributed significantly to the team's rapid learning by explaining my understanding of React Components and array methods, proving pivotal for completing the app successfully within one day. The project enhanced my understanding of React component rendering and JSX. The project's success highlights my effectiveness as a communicator and team member who is committed to the continuous learning for both myself and others. Win logic to be implemented soon.",
